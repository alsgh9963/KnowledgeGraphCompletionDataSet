# KnowledgeGraphCompletionDataSet
```
    This repository contains datasets for building nationality and job inference models.
```
## Data overview
```description01
    In this project, we trained the model based on two 'relations'. The two 'relations' are 'nationality' and 'job'. 
    Each 'relation' has negative data and positive data.
```

## Data format
```description02
    This data is 3 type and each represented by a sequence of the following format.
    
    1. seed, r1, e2, r2, e3, r3, target
    2. seed, r1, e2, r2, target
    3. seed, r1, target
    
    * seed - Start Entity
    * target - Target Entity
    * r1, r2, r3 - Relation
    * e2, e3 - Entity
```
