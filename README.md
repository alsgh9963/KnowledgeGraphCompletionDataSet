## Data overview
```description01
    In this project, we trained the model based on two 'relations'. The two 'relations' are 'nationality' and 'job'. 
    Each 'relation' has negative data and positive data.
```

## Data format
```description02
    In this project, we eliminated triples about coordinates, time and dates.  
    In addition, ambiguous data related to the university's sports team were excluded.
