# Knowledge Graph Completion DataSet
```
    This repository contains datasets for learning knowledge graph completion.
```
## Data overview
```
    In this project, we trained the model based on target relations. 
    Each target relations has negative data and positive data.
```

## Data format
```
   This data is represented by a sequence of the following n-triple format.
   n-triple - a format for storing and transmitting data. 
            - a line-based, plain text serialisation format for RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs.
            - a subset of the Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) format.
   <subject, relation, object>
```
